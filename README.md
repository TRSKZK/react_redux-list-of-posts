This demo were created as exercise for a REDUX library, it contains a little bit of MUI and small amount of scss, just to make it look not too ugly. I used functional components with hooks and tried to optimize perfomance with React.memo. It's connected to small API with post for a student practice, but deleteion of the post doesn't involve server, just practiced to manage my redux state.
